<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Welcome to my project! My name is Ilir, and I'm a first-year student in the EC Webbutveckling .NET program. This project is part of my journey to learn and master web development using ASP.NET, C#, and other modern technologies.</p>

<h2>What is this project about?</h2>
<p>This project is a <strong>Project Management System</strong> designed to help users manage tasks, projects, and teams efficiently. It includes features such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>User authentication and authorization.</li>
    <li>Creating, updating, and deleting projects and tasks.</li>
    <li>Tracking progress and deadlines.</li>
    <li>A responsive and user-friendly interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why did I build this?</h2>
<p>As a beginner in web development, I wanted to create something practical that combines both front-end and back-end skills. This project allows me to apply what I've learned about:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ASP.NET Core MVC</li>
    <li>Entity Framework Core</li>
    <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
    <li>Database design and management</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I'm constantly learning and improving my skills. In the future, I plan to add more advanced features, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Integration with third-party APIs.</li>
    <li>Real-time notifications.</li>
    <li>Enhanced security features.</li>
</ul>
